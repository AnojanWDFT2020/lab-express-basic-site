    Biden was a longtime member of the Senate
    Foreign Relations Committee, and eventually its
    chairman. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991 and
    supported expanding the NATO alliance into
    Eastern Europe and its intervention in the
    Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. He supported the
    resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, and
    later opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He
    also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from
    1987 to 1995, dealing with drug policy, crime
    prevention, and civil liberties issues; led the effort
    to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law
    Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women
    Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court
    confirmation hearings, including the contentious
    hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.
    He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
    presidential nomination in 1988 and again in 2008.
